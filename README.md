In this repository, I’ve included several LLM-related projects. I started by training an LLM, then implemented GRPO from scratch. Using GRPO, I trained reasoning models in two ways: one with my custom GRPO implementation and another using the Hugging Face library.

The file customGrpo.py contains my custom GRPO setup for training reasoning models, and customgrpotrain.py , grpotraining.py is used to run the training process. Additionally, train.py is used to train a LLaMA model.

This project is a personal learning experiment, not intended for commercial use. As such, the documentation is minimal—I haven’t had time to fully write everything out.

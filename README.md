In this repo, I’ve added several LLM-related applications. First, I trained an LLM, then used GRPO to train a reasoning model. The repo also includes a RAG-based application.

In customGrpo.py, I implemented a custom GRPO setup for training reasoning models, and you can use grpotraining.py to run the training process.

This project is just a fun way for me to learn and experiment, so the documentation is not great, I haven’t had the time to write everything out. It’s not a commercial project.
